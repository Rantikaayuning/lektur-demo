          React is a JavaScript library created for building fast and interactive user interfaces for web and mobile applications. It is an open-source, component-based, front-end library responsible only for the applicationâ€™s view layer. In Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, the view layer is responsible for how the app looks and feels. React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. The create react app package can help you to set up your basic environment to start a new single page application. It makes using third party libraries, live-editing CSS and JSS in development and scaling to many files and components easier for you, by combining React, React-Dom with many other dependencies.
